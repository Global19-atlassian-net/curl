This is a quick-and-dirty proof-of-concept to add Token Binding support to `libcurl` and `curl`.

#### Quickstart with Docker
Type `make` in the `docker` subdirectory to create a Docker image that builds and runs token-binding-enabled curl with all dependencies against a public test site.

#### Build it yourself

##### Prerequisites:
- OpenSSL 1.1.x
- checkout the `token_bind` source tree and create symbolic links in `lib/vtls` to the following files:
  - `token_bind_client.c`
  - `token_bind_common.c`
  - `cbs.c`
  - `cbb.c`
  - `base64.c`

##### Build
```
autoreconf --force --install && rm -rf autom4te.cache/
./configure --with-ssl=/usr/local --with-token-binding=<full_path_to_source>/token_bind
mqke && make install
```

##### Test
```
/usr/local/bin/curl -v https://www.zmartzone.eu:4433
```
Confirm that the `Sec-Token-Binding` header is present in the request and the `Provided-Token-Binding-Id` is in the JSON response (as a forwarded header).
```

Curl is a command-line tool for transferring data specified with URL
syntax. Find out how to use curl by reading [the curl.1 man
page](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) or [the MANUAL
document](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manual.html). Find out how to install Curl
by reading [the INSTALL document](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/install.html).

libcurl is the library curl is using to do its job. It is readily available to
be used by your software. Read [the libcurl.3 man
page](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl.html) to learn how!

You find answers to the most frequent questions we get in [the FAQ
document](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/faq.html).
